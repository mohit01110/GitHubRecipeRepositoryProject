# Cheesy Veg Sandwich

> This Cheesy Veg Sandwich recipe is an outcome of the cravings I had when I wanted to have something cheesy and filling and not to mention healthy as well. So when my hunger pangs were getting the best of me I opened my refrigerator to see what options i had… i came across some regular vegetables that we mostly all have in our fridge and cheese slices and i started dreaming of some grilled cheese sandwich and scattered around in the kitchen to see if i had some bread, fortunately for me i was in luck and then one thing led to another and i made this sandwich which was a super hit… happy to say that yummy was in my tummy..
